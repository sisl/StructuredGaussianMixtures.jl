# StructuredGaussianMixtures.jl

A Julia package for fitting and conditional prediction of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with structured covariance matrices.

## Key Features

- **Efficient high-dimensional fitting**: Different fitting methods, including those that efficiently fit low-rank covariance structures for `m â‰« n` settings
- **Conditional prediction**: Compute posterior distributions over unobserved variables
- **Weighted fitting**: Support for weighted data points in model fitting

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("StructuredGaussianMixtures")
```

## Methods

This package implements three main fitting methods for Gaussian Mixture Models:

- **FactorEM** uses EM to fit a GMM with low-rank-plus-diagonal covariance structure $\Sigma = FF' + D$, using an inner EM step to update the covariance components. This is the only method that currently supports weighted fitting
- **EM** uses standard EM to fit a GMM with full rank convariance
- **PCAEM** fits a GMM with low-rank-plus-diagonal covariance structure by fitting a full-rank GMM on PCA-compressed data

## Quick Start

```julia
using StructuredGaussianMixtures

# Fit a GMM using EM
data = randn(100, 1000)  # 100D data with 1000 samples
w = rand(1000) # weights on data 
gmm = fit(FactorEM(3,5), data, w)  # 3-component rank-5 low-rank-plus-diagonal GMM

# Make predictions
query_point = [0.5]
posterior = predict(gmm, query_point)  # Posterior over dimensions 2:100 when x1 = 0.5
```
